STUDY
Study Identifier	"GSK-Longitudinal"
Study Title	"Human metabolic profiles associated with food intake and exercise"
Study Description	"Nine healthy male subjects participated in a study to examine the influence of diet and exercise interventions on longitudinal metabolic profiles of plasma. This study was managed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) who provided the plasma samples as part of the HUSERMET project. All male volunteers were aged between 26 and 35 years, with a body mass index between 20.9 and 25.6. Four regimens combining differential food and exercise interventions were followed in random order by each of the male volunteers (Table 6.1) and their plasma samples were taken at 8 different time points (TP) during each regimen. All volunteers were placed on a controlled diet 24 hours prior to the start of each regimen. The first set of plasma samples (TP 0) were taken from individuals in the morning at 8 am after overnight fasting. Thereafter, two groups of volunteers received breakfast (volunteers following regimens A and C; food+ intervention), whilst the other two groups did not consume food at this time (volunteers following regimens B and D; food- intervention). The next set of plasma samples were taken at 9 am (TP 1) and 12 noon (TP 4). Volunteers following the exercise+ intervention (regimens B and C) then exercised for 30 min at 60% of maximum heart rate level, whilst the volunteers following exercise- intervention (regimens A and D) did not undertake any physical activity. The fourth set of plasma samples was taken at 1 pm (TP 5). After this time point, volunteers of all regimens followed the same schedule for food and drink intake, and additional samples were taken at 4 pm (TP 8), 8 pm (TP 12), 11 pm (TP 16) and at 8 am the following day (TP 24). After completing the first regimen, each volunteer followed a controlled diet for the next 24 hours before starting another randomly selected regimen. After completion of this second regimen, all volunteers were discharged and then re-admitted after two weeks to undergo the remaining two regimens. Each of the regimens was again preceded by a 24 hour controlled diet."
